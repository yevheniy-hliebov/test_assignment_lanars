  - Input fields and button are disabled during the request.

## Used Packages:
- bloc
- dio  
- retrofit
- auto_route  

Additionally, the following dependencies are used:
- flutter_bloc  
- retrofit_generator  
- auto_route_generator  
- build_runner


## CI/CD for Build and Release Publication
I added CI/CD for publishing APK and iOS builds to the release in GitHub.
So, you can test the app by downloading either the APK or the iOS build from the release (unfortunately, I donâ€™t have a macOS system, so I'm unsure if it will work correctly or even if it will function properly).

## How to Build and Run the Project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yevheniy-hliebov/test_assignment_lanars.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd test_assignment_lanars
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    flutter run
